##  I performed data-pipeline-development. I used python 3.13.This code can be able to run in idle python 3.13 after installing pip and downloading modules.The primary modules used in the script are from the pandas and scikit-learn libraries.The sqlite3 module is included but commented out, indicating it’s optional for loading data into a database.These modules collectively enable the ETL process by handling data extraction, transformation (imputation, scaling, encoding), and loading.
