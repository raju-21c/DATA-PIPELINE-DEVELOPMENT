##  I PERFORMED DATA-PIPELINE-DEVELOPMENT I USED PYTHON 3.13 THIS CODE CAN ABLE TO RUN IN IDLE PYTHON 3.13.The primary modules used in the script are from the pandas and scikit-learn libraries.The sqlite3 module is included but commented out, indicating itâ€™s optional for loading data into a database.These modules collectively enable the ETL process by handling data extraction, transformation (imputation, scaling, encoding), and loading.
